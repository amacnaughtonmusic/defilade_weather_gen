--- DEFILADE WEATHER GENERATOR ---

This is a simple weather generation tool for my TTRPG, Defilade. It provides forecasting for Morning, Afternoon and Night, and uses a simple weather transition method meaning that you can't jump wildly from one weather type to another (such as clear to blizzard) without some build up (such as clear -> foggy -> light snow -> heavy snow etc.). There's also a section for randomised daily events.

It is easily editable to give different weather types, ranges of temperature and windspeed, and random events. Feel free to do whatever you want with the code.
